## Optimizers

### Major problem of Gradient Descent approach - (can‚Äôt reach global minima):

#### Getting stuck in local minima -

#### Saddle points : Minima in one direction but maxima in another direction.

Optimizers help to reach the global minima of loss curve with higher probability.

### Different variants of Optimizers :

#### üî∏ Momentum based Gradient Descent :

Gradient Descent uses only the current gradient (point gradient).

**Update Rule:**

Momentum based Gradient Descent uses both historical and current gradient info.

**Update Rule:**

Gamma here is a hyperparameter.

`momentum_t` is an accumulator variable.

Orange ball ‚Üí Momentum based GD  
Blue ball ‚Üí Vanilla GD

Note that momentum based GD takes more time or more oscillations to settle down than vanilla GD because of the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù it carries.
